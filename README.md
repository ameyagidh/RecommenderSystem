## Features

- **User Profile Collection**: Collects comprehensive user profiles including demographic information (name, age, gender) and academic details (start term, study plan, level of study, degree, previously taken courses) through HTML forms.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocesses the collected data to handle missing values, standardize formats, and encode categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Trains a collaborative filtering model using techniques such as matrix factorization or deep learning methods to learn patterns from user profiles and course interactions.
- **Recommendation Generation**: Generates course recommendations for each user based on similar user profiles and previously taken courses. Utilizes techniques like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance for user similarity measurement.
- **Ranking**: Ranks recommended courses based on factors like the number of students who have taken the course and the average grade of those students.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the performance of the recommendation system using metrics like precision, recall, and accuracy. Incorporates user feedback to refine the recommendations over time.
- **User Interface**: Provides an intuitive user interface where students can input their profile information and view the recommended courses.
- **Privacy and Security**: Adheres to privacy regulations and guidelines to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.
